**Machine Learning Project on South African coronary heart disease dataset** <br>

**Abstract** <br>
Data was obtained from Stanford.edu.. This data is a retrospective sample
gathered from a original dataset gathered and presented by Roussowet al.1.
The next paragraphs goes through the data in detail: 1) what the data
is about (and what purpose of collecting it was) 2) how it was originally
analyzed and 3) what machine learning tasks we intend to perform on it. <br> <br>
In their original paper, the authors explain how there is increased incidence
of coronary heart disease (CHD) in rural, white, South African (SA) villages.
To investigate what is causing this, researchers had 3357 males and 3831 fe-
males in the area enrolled into a study mapping dierent attributes possibly
aecting CHD development. Some of the attributes measured include: blood
pressure, BMI and smoking habits. The measured attributes were then com-
pared to a threshold value known to be associated with CHD. For example:
a systolic blood pressure above 160 mm Hg is known to be a risk factor
for CHD, and all the people with a blood pressure above the treshold were
marked as having blood pressure as a risk factor. 73 % of men and 67 % of
women showed at least one attribute exceeding the threshold cut-o, making
the researchers conclude that the population have a high prevalence of CHD
risk factors, that could explain the high CHD prevalence. <br>
